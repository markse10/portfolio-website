            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              FUND$ is a financial app for people who don't like working with their finances but want to save money quickly for a purpose, i.e. vacation,
              wedding, down payment, etc. FUND$ will appeal to users that are less familiar with their finances and will provide simple, clear messaging
              as well as offer guidance and motivation for users to make savings fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              A finance app that you can control, gain personal insights, and receive the motivation you need to save for the special moments in your life.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Brand Values</h3>

            <li>Trust</li>

            Define your user
          </h3>
          <p>
            Before designing my app, I needed to learn about what users want in a money-saving app. I needed to define the 5 W's, define my user stories, and create a user flow.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Who?</li>
            <li>What?</li>
            <li>When?</li>
            <li>Where?</li>
            <li>Why?</li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            <h3>
              User Stories
            </h3>
            <div>
              <p>Who is my user and what do they want to do with this app?.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Track Spending</h3>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>As a user, I want to see a dashboard of my finances clearly so that I can see how much I am spending on what at a glance.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Set Goals</h3>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>As a user, I need to be able to tell the tool what my savings goal is and how long I have to reach it, so I can save accordingly.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Create a Budget</h3>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>As a money-saver, I need to be able to input information on the money I am receiving and spending (and on what), so that I can see an overview of my finances.</p>
          </div>
          <h3>User Flow</h3>

              Low-Fidelity Wireframes
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p>At this point in my project, I started designing the initial app screens as low-fidelity wireframes</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/fund$/low-fidelity-wireframes.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

        <h3>
          Brand Logo
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>When you think of saving money, you think of a piggy bank. I wanted to evoke a sense of trust and simplicity with the FUND$ app. Using
            a simple piggy bank outline with a coin is instantly recognized as a symbol of saving money.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <h3>
          Brand Colors
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>The color scheme I chose provokes a sense of trust while remaining cool and calm. The yellow accent is there to show
            happiness, joy, and accessibility. FUND$ strives to evoke feelings of genuinity, positivity, and caring.</p>

          <p>FUND$ strives for clear and concise messaging. We want our brand to be bold, simple, and easy to read so I elected to use the Roboto font.</p>

          <p>After coming up with the style guide for FUND$, it was time for me to start on my Mid-Fidelity Wireframes so I could further develop my design and start user testing.</p>

        <h3>
          User Testing
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>In the user testing phase, I wanted to pick certain scenarios that were needed for basic use of the app.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>From the dashboard, navigate to your transactions and back to dashboard. Then navigate to see your savings goals.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Open a savings goal and add money to it.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Sort transactions, click on them to edit the category if needed.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>
          Revisions
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>After completed my user testing, I recorded some user responses and made the appropriate changes.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>User 1</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>"I don't like the graph icon. I would want to see an actual graph of my current financial status."</p>
        <p>I will add an actual Sankey graph diagram with real categories and totals.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>User 2</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>"It could be confusing to see what is a debit and credit on the transactions page. Are you going to make sure they stand out?"</p>
        <p>When designing this for my final screens, I will make sure debits and credits are different colors so there is no confusion.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>User 3</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>“Change the add money bar to fund gift or something. I wasn’t sure what I was adding money to. On the add money screen, there is a save function. Is that actually funding the goal or just a saved intention?”</p>
        <p> I changed the name of the screen to Fund Goal and changed the saved button to a Fund button.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>User 4</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>“There is not a due date on the goal information page. It would be nice to also see how much you have saved towards your goal on the details page.”</p>
        <p> I will add a due date on the Fund Goal screen. I will also include the amount saved towards the target amount on the details page.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>
          High-Fidelity Wireframes
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>After I finalized my user testing and revisions, I created my High-Fidelity Wireframes.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <h3>
          Key Takeaways
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>FUND$ was the latest project I completed for my CareerFoundry program. I have definitely learned so much and I think it definitely shows in my work. I really loved the branding stage of this project. It was fun to design the
            FUND$ messaging, color scheme, and brand identity. This project was done in very little time and given more time, I would like to do more prototyping and user testing. I definitely see the need to develop more screens and I would
            like to work on the notifications and locked screen messaging. All and all I learned a lot and I am excited to continue gaining new skills and developing into a stronger UI/UX designer. I also learned that I love to create the
            case study for a project. I love how creative you can be and how all your work really comes together.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my money-saving app, FUND$. If you would like to get in touch to hear more about my process, please reach out to me at my contact information below.
          I am always happy to get feedback or to discuss future projects.
