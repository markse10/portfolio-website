              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <p>Hi, I’m Sarah Mark. I am a UI designer with a BFA in Fine Arts and an AAS in Respiratory Care. I am entering the design world after working in healthcare for over 10 years. My past experience has really set me up for success in my
                career change to a UI/UX Designer. I have always been naturally empathetic and working in healthcare really helped to develop and enhance my abilities in identifying the diverse, unique needs of others to care for them. I can hone
                my
                communications skills so that I can effectively tailor my message to people of all age groups and developmental levels.
                Over the past couple of years, it became increasingly clear to me that I was not fully satisfied in my career, and something was missing. I have always been creative, always sketching and drawing. I knew that I needed to pursue a
                career
                that would fulfill me and challenge me. I did a lot of research and when I found UI/UX design, I knew this was career I needed to pursue. It combines my love of design with my empathetic nature and desire to help others identify
                problems and find solutions that work for everyone. From that point, I enrolled in the UI/UX Design program at CareerFoundry. I also started a new job at a small vintage paper goods company where I could start learning and gain
                experience in the digital design world. I now help design website banners, optimize photos for print in Adobe Photoshop, and create Adobe InDesign templates that we use for printing our digital images. I am generally involved in the
                day-to-day operations of the company and am happy to jump in wherever I am needed, whether that’s taking an online course to learn new software, running the printers, or helping with the actual production of our products.
                I really take pride in customer service and am a strong believer of treating others how you want to be treated. You never know who is on the other end of the line and what they are dealing with. I always give others the service I
                would
                like to get, and I try to always leave a conversation on a positive. I want people to feel good after working or speaking with me. I strive to be the person people look to for answers and someone to bounce ideas off. The creative
                process is not done in a vacuum and so much can be learned from working and speaking with others.
